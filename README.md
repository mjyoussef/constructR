# Overview
ConstructR is a beginner-friendly sketchbook for prototyping 2D trusses and frames. It features a drag-and-drop UI that lets users move, resize, and rotate beams or customizable "add-ons" that users can upload directly from their computer. 

#### Drag-and-Drop
* Dragging: select the item, and drag it anywhere within the canvas
* Resizing and rotating: hold down the "Shift" key and resize or hold down the letter key "r" and rotate. If an item is not currently selected, then no changes will be displayed.

#### Cache
* To revert changes, use the backward/forward arrows on the top of the sketch canvas.
* You can delete your sketch by pressing the "Clear Sketch" button. Note that this will erase the cache, so you cannot undo this step. 

## Adding/Deleting Items
To add a beam to your sketch canvas, simply click on the "Add Beam" button in the library. To delete an item, make sure it is selected and press "delete". 

## Adding Customizable Components
You can add your own add-ons (ie. pin joints, rollers, annotations for force diagrams, etc) by uploading an image from your computer. Every component that you add is displayed in the library on the right with a button that lets you add it to the sketch or delete it entirely from the library. Note that deleting an add-on from the library will NOT delete any of its instances in the sketch.
